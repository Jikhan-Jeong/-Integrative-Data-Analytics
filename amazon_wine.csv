Like other southern sodas (e.g., Royal Crown), Cheerwine is a little sweeter and less heavily carbonated.  Don't leave the lid off bottles of Cheerwine for long - it will go completely flat.  The taste is mellow and unusual, not at all like cherry cola or cherry 7UP - more like cream soda with cherries added.  I first tasted Cheerwine when I moved to North Carolina a few years ago; it was unlike any other soda I'd had before, and I buy it often now.

Today, Cheerwine is available throughout the South and serves as the perfect accompaniment to a humid summer day.

We noticed immediately the ubiquitous advertisements for Cheerwine everywhere, from billboards on the side of the interstate to almost ancient Cheerwine paintings on the sides of some of the older historic buildings in town. And if the locals weren't drinking sweet tea they had a Cheerwine in their hands. And at the age of 9, after my first bottle, I understood why. The stuff is *good*. It's addictively good.

Cheerwine is a deep red/burgundy color and will stain your carpet, so don't drop any. As to how to describe the taste, saying it's ""Cherry flavored soda"" is not quite adequate. It's more like liquid cherry candy. It is very sweet, probably a lot sweeter than most soda drinkers are used to, and finishes on your palate extremely well. I tend to think it goes well with almost any food but find it complements pork BBQ best. And if you manage to get your mitts on the glass bottle Cheerwine be prepared for a really exuisite taste treat as it's manufactured with real cane sugar in lieu of corn syrup, and the difference is noticeable.

If Cheerwine has any one drawback it's that the stuff goes flat very fast. If you pop open a can make sure to drink it within an hour's time because flat Cheerwine is pretty wretched stuff (in the same way that cold black coffee is). This is one of the reasons I almost never get the 2-liter bottle of the stuff unless I'm at a social gathering and it's guaranteed to go within a short amount of time. If you can find it, the Cheerwine ice cream (either homemade, a perennial favorite at church picnics, or the Cheerwine Company type you can buy at the store, also good) is also delicious. It's a unique soda that I cannot recommend highly enough.

The item description(s) could hardly be more confusing if they tried.
The horrible changed recipe candies that arrived are NOT labeled ""NEW RECIPE"".
The original candies that almost everyone loves ARE labeled ""NEW RECIPE"".
Both versions say Item number 31814. What could possibly go wrong?

What went wrong is that the new concoction is terrible.
I suspect that Amazon's rating of 3.9 out of 5 has not separated reviews of the original recipe from changed recipe that is receiving a lot of complaints.
I am also not sure what flavor of arithmetic they are using to arrive at this figure.

The original recipe says on the label (which is on both the box and each package):
Gustaf's NEW RECIPE
WINE GUMS
ITEM #31814
The candies are translucent, with subdued colors and delicious.

The recently changed recipe says on the label (which was on the box only):
Gustaf's Item nr: 31814
WINE GUMS
The new attempts are opaque with bright unnatural colors and very undelicous.

Why the Item numbers on both is 31814 shall remain a mystery to me.

I, and I'm sure many others, would like to have a little better clarification as to which product we are ordering.
Most of us did not realize there were even 2 products to chose from.
Best would be to not sell the new formula at all.
Of the many reviews I read, certainly not all 222, I did not see one that said,
""I like the new ones even better."" Many said, ""I will never order these again!""
However, I am going to make one more attempt to order the original Gustaf's NEW RECIPE WINE GUMS.

If that is not possible, I'm afraid Amazon will enjoy many more happy returns.",These things are awful!!!!,4.0,"['Grocery & Gourmet Food', 'Candy & Chocolate', 'Jelly Beans & Gummy Candy', 'Gummy Candy']","['Wine gums are the popular alternative to gummis in Europe.

When I first found Gustaf's wine gums about 5 or 6 years ago they were the best gummy candy that i had ever had. I quickly adopted a tradition of giving packs of them to family members as Christmas gifts and they were universally loved. My personal favorite has always been the currant flavored one. The texture was soft but a bit chewy and the flavors were great and not quite as sweet most other gummy offerings.

Then sometime within the past two years they did change the recipe and to my dismay the change was for the worst. So what changed?  Well the flavors seem to be pretty close to the originals, although I must admit that non from the original bags survived so this was not a side by side comparison.. but the big thing for me was that the texture was completely different. The ""new recipe"" is tougher to chew. That does not sound so bad  but it does leave me wondering why they would change something so good. The shapes changed too but that did not bother me. Anyway the change sent me on a search for a better option so I started buying every brand wine gum that I could find.

The results of this search left me wanting. These Gustaf's Wine Gums are still the best that i can find which is why a feel obligated to give them four stars and I still purchase them, enjoy them and give them as gifts but inevitably someone who receives them asks why they are not the same and I regret to tell them that ""I don't know"". I will come back to this review and change it to five stars if any of my future purchases seem to go back to that original recipe but for now I just chew a little harder.",Let me explain,5.0,"['Grocery & Gourmet Food', 'Candy & Chocolate', 'Jelly Beans & Gummy Candy', 'Gummy Candy']","['Wine gums are the popular alternative to gummis in Europe.

So after more than 2 decades back stateside I had a craving for the real gummies I enjoyed in Germany. I was delighted to find I could ordered Haribo products from Amazon, and was thrilled when the product arrived stating it was made in Spain,  But after ordering more over of a few years, I wanted something different.  I read several reviews (back in 2012) about Gustaf's Wine gums. I ordered the 3 pack from Amazon,  and knew that I would never needed to order Haribo Gummy Bears again!  The texture the flavors and the large size  gums made them an instant favorite and I quickly shared them with friends and co-workers trying to convince them to stop eating the American Haribo knockoffs (which sadly don't even taste as good as their European cousins). Then proceeded to order more every six months or so.
So you might be wandering since I have waxed so fondly over Gustafs wine gums why have I gave the product only one star?
Good question, and the answer is the product label that consumers world wide have come to hate ""New and Improved"".  So what has changed in the new and improved wine gums? Everything but the shapes and the alcohol names molded into the shapes. First the gums are smaller, I could forgive this, but the wonderful fruity flavors I came to adore, are gone!  All of the gums now taste the same! Worst yet the gums tasted waxy. If I wanted crappy wax flavored candy I would just have bought the inferior American made gummies or Mike & Ikes!
Even worse two of the three bags tasted stale, I wasn't sure if this was due to air leaks in the bags, or the manufactures poor quality control.  So sadly unless Gustafs goes back to its old formula (like Coke did with the ""new coke"" fiasco, I will never buy these third rate candies again!  Anyone suggest a better Wine Gum that comes in similar size bags?","Sometimes the old phrase is right; if it ain't broke don't fix it!

I have been ordering (many!) boxes of these for years and loved them (and always ran out quickly)....I re-ordered last week (b/c I couldn't wait for next subscription) and got shipment this week.  I was shocked to discover they looked different,  and then when I ate a few, I found out that they tasted awful (esp compared to prior versions).  I have literally tried all kinds of wine gums and had after much trial and error discovered that these (in the past) were a great flavorful option and the size/price were a good value, plus being on amazon, I could easily get them.

But apparently they changed the recipe and tried to slip them right in there thinking no one would notice---there were some smaller words on the label that said ""new recipe"" that I only saw after tasting them and wondering what I was eating that I looked at the package--I definitely noticed.  I swear, I wish manufacturers would just stay with their product....just like ""new coke"" sometimes ""new"" isn't the way to go and it can make a lot of loyal customers very mad (note to the exec team at Gustaf's:  read the case studies on that fiasco).  I cannot figure why they would change something that a lot of people enjoyed and was well-reviewed as is.

These 'new' wine gums are just awful....they have minimal flavor, and even those flavors are weird and not identifiable. The texture has also changed--the pieces are much smaller and more dense--almost rubbery, whereas before they were thicker and smoother--a very unique texture that I personally preferred over others.  Plus, the price of the box has risen substantially.  No clue why they changed things, but they've lost me as a customer.  I can only hope that I can get a refund of this order from amazon because I'm not able to bring myself to eat them and waste the calories.  I'm so frustrated with Gustaf's.......",AAAKKKK---Buyer Beware!

I guess I am an uncouth American who prefers punched-up fruity flavors to these European flavors.  The gums come in various shapes like diamonds, circles, and rectangles.  They are labeled with names like cider, port, rum, and cognac.  The consistency is good, chewy, and soft.  They don't stick to your teeth, not even dental work.  They are each about the size of a quarter.  Vegans and vegetarians should note that, although the description says they don't contain gelatin, the ingredients list says they do.  I wouldn't order these again, because the flavors are so different from what I currently seek.  If you enjoy these, you get a huge amount delivered.

None of the packaging had any identifying labels--not the manufacturer, not the ingredients, nothing. Just three clear cellophane bags. One of the bags had broken open, and a good third of the gummies were loose in the box. Undaunted, I sampled some of the spilled candy and Did Not Die.

The Pros:  These have to be the absolute best gummies I have ever tasted, bar none. They definitely resemble the candies in the Amazon picture, so I assume they ARE the Gustaf's brand. The flavors are delicious and unique, unlike many of the more kid-centric candies on the market. They are not for the weak of teeth, however, possessing a very persistent but satisfying chewiness. I love all of the flavors, although I cannot necessarily identify them. (Pear! There's definitely pear!)

The Verdict:  I'd give these five stars were it not for the packaging issues.

The item description(s) could hardly be more confusing if they tried.
The horrible changed recipe candies that arrived are NOT labeled ""NEW RECIPE"".
The original candies that almost everyone loves ARE labeled ""NEW RECIPE"".
Both versions say Item number 31814. What could possibly go wrong?

What went wrong is that the new concoction is terrible.
I suspect that Amazon's rating of 3.9 out of 5 has not separated reviews of the original recipe from changed recipe that is receiving a lot of complaints.
I am also not sure what flavor of arithmetic they are using to arrive at this figure.

The original recipe says on the label (which is on both the box and each package):
Gustaf's NEW RECIPE
WINE GUMS
ITEM #31814
The candies are translucent, with subdued colors and delicious.

The recently changed recipe says on the label (which was on the box only):
Gustaf's Item nr: 31814
WINE GUMS
The new attempts are opaque with bright unnatural colors and very undelicous.

Why the Item numbers on both is 31814 shall remain a mystery to me.

I, and I'm sure many others, would like to have a little better clarification as to which product we are ordering.
Most of us did not realize there were even 2 products to chose from.
Best would be to not sell the new formula at all.
Of the many reviews I read, certainly not all 222, I did not see one that said,
""I like the new ones even better."" Many said, ""I will never order these again!""
However, I am going to make one more attempt to order the original Gustaf's NEW RECIPE WINE GUMS.

If that is not possible, I'm afraid Amazon will enjoy many more happy returns.",These things are awful!!!!,4.0,"['Grocery & Gourmet Food', 'Candy & Chocolate', 'Jelly Beans & Gummy Candy', 'Gummy Candy']","['Wine gums are the popular alternative to gummis in Europe.

When I first found Gustaf's wine gums about 5 or 6 years ago they were the best gummy candy that i had ever had. I quickly adopted a tradition of giving packs of them to family members as Christmas gifts and they were universally loved. My personal favorite has always been the currant flavored one. The texture was soft but a bit chewy and the flavors were great and not quite as sweet most other gummy offerings.

Then sometime within the past two years they did change the recipe and to my dismay the change was for the worst. So what changed?  Well the flavors seem to be pretty close to the originals, although I must admit that non from the original bags survived so this was not a side by side comparison.. but the big thing for me was that the texture was completely different. The ""new recipe"" is tougher to chew. That does not sound so bad  but it does leave me wondering why they would change something so good. The shapes changed too but that did not bother me. Anyway the change sent me on a search for a better option so I started buying every brand wine gum that I could find.

The results of this search left me wanting. These Gustaf's Wine Gums are still the best that i can find which is why a feel obligated to give them four stars and I still purchase them, enjoy them and give them as gifts but inevitably someone who receives them asks why they are not the same and I regret to tell them that ""I don't know"". I will come back to this review and change it to five stars if any of my future purchases seem to go back to that original recipe but for now I just chew a little harder.",Let me explain,5.0,"['Grocery & Gourmet Food', 'Candy & Chocolate', 'Jelly Beans & Gummy Candy', 'Gummy Candy']","['Wine gums are the popular alternative to gummis in Europe.

So after more than 2 decades back stateside I had a craving for the real gummies I enjoyed in Germany. I was delighted to find I could ordered Haribo products from Amazon, and was thrilled when the product arrived stating it was made in Spain,  But after ordering more over of a few years, I wanted something different.  I read several reviews (back in 2012) about Gustaf's Wine gums. I ordered the 3 pack from Amazon,  and knew that I would never needed to order Haribo Gummy Bears again!  The texture the flavors and the large size  gums made them an instant favorite and I quickly shared them with friends and co-workers trying to convince them to stop eating the American Haribo knockoffs (which sadly don't even taste as good as their European cousins). Then proceeded to order more every six months or so.
So you might be wandering since I have waxed so fondly over Gustafs wine gums why have I gave the product only one star?
Good question, and the answer is the product label that consumers world wide have come to hate ""New and Improved"".  So what has changed in the new and improved wine gums? Everything but the shapes and the alcohol names molded into the shapes. First the gums are smaller, I could forgive this, but the wonderful fruity flavors I came to adore, are gone!  All of the gums now taste the same! Worst yet the gums tasted waxy. If I wanted crappy wax flavored candy I would just have bought the inferior American made gummies or Mike & Ikes!
Even worse two of the three bags tasted stale, I wasn't sure if this was due to air leaks in the bags, or the manufactures poor quality control.  So sadly unless Gustafs goes back to its old formula (like Coke did with the ""new coke"" fiasco, I will never buy these third rate candies again!  Anyone suggest a better Wine Gum that comes in similar size bags?","Sometimes the old phrase is right; if it ain't broke don't fix it!

I have been ordering (many!) boxes of these for years and loved them (and always ran out quickly)....I re-ordered last week (b/c I couldn't wait for next subscription) and got shipment this week.  I was shocked to discover they looked different,  and then when I ate a few, I found out that they tasted awful (esp compared to prior versions).  I have literally tried all kinds of wine gums and had after much trial and error discovered that these (in the past) were a great flavorful option and the size/price were a good value, plus being on amazon, I could easily get them.

But apparently they changed the recipe and tried to slip them right in there thinking no one would notice---there were some smaller words on the label that said ""new recipe"" that I only saw after tasting them and wondering what I was eating that I looked at the package--I definitely noticed.  I swear, I wish manufacturers would just stay with their product....just like ""new coke"" sometimes ""new"" isn't the way to go and it can make a lot of loyal customers very mad (note to the exec team at Gustaf's:  read the case studies on that fiasco).  I cannot figure why they would change something that a lot of people enjoyed and was well-reviewed as is.

These 'new' wine gums are just awful....they have minimal flavor, and even those flavors are weird and not identifiable. The texture has also changed--the pieces are much smaller and more dense--almost rubbery, whereas before they were thicker and smoother--a very unique texture that I personally preferred over others.  Plus, the price of the box has risen substantially.  No clue why they changed things, but they've lost me as a customer.  I can only hope that I can get a refund of this order from amazon because I'm not able to bring myself to eat them and waste the calories.  I'm so frustrated with Gustaf's.......",AAAKKKK---Buyer Beware!

Although not as good as Bassett's, these wine gums are very good.  I was impressed with how quickly they arrived (less than a week), as well as the quantity (three large bags).

I tried a few at first but they disappointed me a little.  Didn't seem chewy enough.  However, after I put them in the refrigerator for a few hours, I tried them again.  Wow!  They were a knock-out and I found that I couldn't stop eating the things.  It got to a point where I was eating about 50 in a single sitting -- night after night.  Not exactly a healthy habit.  My son-in-law loves them, too, so I plan on sharing any future purchases with him in order to preserve my waistline.

They are labeled with names like cider, port, rum, and cognac.  The consistency is good, chewy, and soft.  They don't stick to your teeth, not even dental work.  They are each about the size of a quarter.  Vegans and vegetarians should note that, although the description says they don't contain gelatin, the ingredients list says they do.

None of the packaging had any identifying labels--not the manufacturer, not the ingredients, nothing. Just three clear cellophane bags. One of the bags had broken open, and a good third of the gummies were loose in the box. Undaunted, I sampled some of the spilled candy and Did Not Die.

The Pros:  These have to be the absolute best gummies I have ever tasted, bar none. They definitely resemble the candies in the Amazon picture, so I assume they ARE the Gustaf's brand. The flavors are delicious and unique, unlike many of the more kid-centric candies on the market. They are not for the weak of teeth, however, possessing a very persistent but satisfying chewiness. I love all of the flavors, although I cannot necessarily identify them. (Pear! There's definitely pear!)

The Verdict:  I'd give these five stars were it not for the packaging issues.

The flavors are in fact just one...disguised by color. If you do not look at shape and color you will never be able to taste the difference between the pieces!
And the texture has changed dramatically to something like a gooey, sticky mess.
I tried to return the other 3 bags but without success. I couldn't even get thru a handful of these....things.
The people who have taken over the manufacturing of these delicacies have destroyed everything the brand stood for, in the name of profit by way of cheap ingredients. Theyve miscalculated the whole demographic of the target buyer:  who spends quite a bit more money to have a delicacy that doesn't taste like sugar & detergent.

I like to mix it lighter than the instructions... I use the amount of water and oil the instructions call for (I think 1/4 cup of each?), but only half a packet of seasoning. It would probably be fine full-strength, too, but we also are cooking for picky-ish kiddos :-) Plus I'm usually not using the full amount of meat they call for.
I LOVE this for keeping in the camper! I can have a bunch of different flavor packets, but the only liquid I need to bring is oil and water. Plus, there aren't any half-full... or half-empty?? :-)... bottles of marinade taking up room in our tiny camper fridge!! The package says you can try different juices as the liquid part, but I like the oil/water/packet flavor so much that I don't want to change it!! We've just used it for chicken breasts so far.
I like to put two raw chicken breasts (I wash them before I freeze them, I know they say now that you shouldn't, but that grosses me out) in a quart size ziploc bag (so they're flat, not stacked on top of each other), then freeze them flat. Then when we're camping, I can just pull out however many bags we'll need (for supper) after lunch, mix up the marinade, and split it up between the bags, and they're perfectly thawed by supper time, with no raw chicken germs in the camper (where you have limited water for cleanup). It also works to chunk up a few chicken breasts, I like to do 1.5 breasts per bag. Then my husband grills them on his Weber Q 1000 grill, and we have a delicious supper with minimal effort... Which is what camping (and summer!!) is all about!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Guess I know what we're having for supper tonight! :-)","Delicious, but a very strong flavor if used full-strength",2.0,"['Grocery & Gourmet Food', 'Sauces, Gravies & Marinades', 'Seasoning Mixes']","['Weber White Wine & Herb Marinade Mix.<br>New look!<br>Same great taste.', 'Salt, Maltodextrin, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Spices, Citric Acid, Food Starch-Modified, Red Bell Pepper, Xanthan Gum, Sherry Wine Solids, Parsley, Disodium Inosinate, Vinegar, Artificial Flavor and less than 2% Silicon Dioxide to prevent caking.', 'All you need.<br>1 pack Weber marinade mix + 1/4 cup water + 1/4 cup olive oil or corn oil + 2 lbs fish or chicken.<br>All you do:<br>1.

At first it did the job, they loved how beautiful it looked and were very excited to open up all the boxes (the boxes are tiny in comparison with the pic). After that, the great first impression quickly faded as they opened up the packages to see that all the chocolates had melted and were now stuck together! They couldn't even open the chocolate bars because the foil was stuck to them. I didn't understand how the chocolate could have melted together because I was home when this package was delivered to me, so the package was not outside at any point.

The ingredient list for the 3-pack box is the older, discontinued version.  Reviewers are divided in their response to the new recipe.  I don't think there is much to debate:  the new items are slightly smaller (9 per 40 g serving vs. the the older 7 per serving) and certainly less chewy.  More like a gummy as one reviewer observed.  The taste, however, has been enhanced.  In my view, the different flavors are, in fact, distinguishable (in contrast to another reviewer who thinks they all taste the same), and more intense and flavorful.  They would be perfect if the manufacturer made them more like a wine gum and less like a gummy.  I have been throwing them in the freezer and, as they soften in my mouth, I re-capture some of the old-style chewiness.

UPDATE:  4/25/15.  The ""new recipe"" is the outcome of the manufacturer's decision to make the product gluten free.  The recipe was modified and new equipment was used in the manufacturing process.  Almost all consumers agree that the new product is different from the old product regardless of which one they prefer.  The old recipe is still available as ""Gumbilees"" in 5.2 oz packets.  So the consumer has a choice:  the bulk 3-pack, a total of 6.6 lbs or just over 100 oz or a 12-pack box of Gumbilees (about 66 oz) for roughly the same price on Amazon.
